# imi-bounceback-emails
With this project we were receiving emails which bounced back to us because the users email was no longer good.  Of course the bounce back email didn't contain anything which indicated which project the user was associated with.  So I created this very rudimentary web page which we could plug in the email address and it would automatically find the project manager and send an email to them letting them know that the email address for that user is wrong.
